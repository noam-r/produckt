"""
Background job worker that polls for pending jobs and executes them.

This worker solves the problem of background jobs not executing in production
when using Gunicorn with multiple workers. Instead of spawning threads that
only exist in one worker process, this creates a separate background thread
that polls the database for PENDING jobs and executes them.

Architecture:
- Single background thread per application instance
- Polls database every N seconds for PENDING jobs
- Uses database row locking to prevent duplicate execution
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Works across multiple Gunicorn workers
